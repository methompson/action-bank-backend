# Action Bank
## An Action Conversion Application

The action bank is a online system that allows you to convert actions into other actions. There are many uses for such a conversion system. It can be used to encourage users to perform good actions so that they can spend 'currency' gained from those good actions on more indulgent actions. You can use the system to tabulate poor choices and require an equal or greater quantity of good choices to offset those poor choices. In all situations, the action bank is meant to promote balance and harmony.

### How It Works

When the user uses the action bank, their first step is to create a series of actions that they use to 'earn' currency. For example, a user may select a specific workout, such as a set of arm curls, or a period of time, like jogging for an hour. The user sets up these actions and the conversion rates, so that they can determine how hard it is to earn this currency.

Afterward, the user sets up a series of actions that draws from this pool of currency. These actions can be whatever the user wants, such as 'eat a bowl of ice cream' or 'drink a beer'.

The premise is simple: if you have a vice, you should offset it with 'good' behavior. This application's purpose is to fascilitate this behavior, by allowing a user to keep track of their 'bad' behaviors and earn this behavior through 'good' behaviors.
